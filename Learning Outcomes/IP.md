### how I plan to show this learning outcome in my project: 

To show I have enough knowledge of this learning outcome I made a frontend webapp using javascript. To know which javascript framework I am going to be using for my frontend I have made a [Research Paper](https://github.com/WouterVerschuren/S3Portfolio/blob/main/Documentation/Researches/Javascript%20Framework.md) on which javascript framework would be the best for me and my project. For my backend I made a WepAPI using asp.net C#. My database is being hosted on azure.
