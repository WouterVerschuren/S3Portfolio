What is the most suitable JavaScript framework to use for developing a web application? 

For my frontend project I want to use a JavaScript framework. The main reasons I chose to work with JavaScript are:
1.	Interactivity:
JavaScript enables you to create dynamic and interactive web pages that can respond to user actions in real-time, without requiring a page refresh. This will increase the interactivity.
2.	Improved user Experience: 
Because JavaScript’s interactivity is good, the user experience will also improve making it easier for users to navigate the pages.
3.	Scalability:
JavaScript’s frameworks are designed to make scalability easier. This will be useful to maintain the webapp.


My question now is which framework is the best for my project? 

The 3 most popular JavaScript frameworks are React, Vue and Angular. Let’s look at some pros and cons for each framework. 
1.	React: React is a popular choice for building dynamic and interactive web applications. Its virtual DOM feature enables fast rendering and updates, and its modular architecture makes it easy to build and maintain large-scale applications. React is also widely supported by a large community of developers, and there are many resources available for learning and troubleshooting.
2.	Angular: Angular is a powerful framework that is ideal for building complex web applications. Its two-way data binding feature enables automatic updates to the user interface as data changes, and its dependency injection feature makes it easy to write reusable code. Angular is also well-suited for enterprise-level applications and has a large community and strong documentation.
3.	Vue: Vue is a lightweight and easy-to-learn framework that is well-suited for small to medium-sized applications. Its simple and intuitive syntax makes it easy for developers to learn and use, and its excellent documentation and support make it a popular choice among developers.
