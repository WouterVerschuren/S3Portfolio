## What is the most suitable JavaScript framework to use for developing a web application? 

#### For my frontend project I want to use a JavaScript framework. The main reasons I chose to work with JavaScript are:
### 1.	Interactivity:
JavaScript enables you to create dynamic and interactive web pages that can respond to user actions in real-time, without requiring a page refresh. This will increase the interactivity.
### 2.	Improved user Experience: 
Because JavaScript’s interactivity is good, the user experience will also improve making it easier for users to navigate the pages.
### 3.	Scalability:
JavaScript’s frameworks are designed to make scalability easier. This will be useful to maintain the webapp.
### 4. Experience:
A more personal reason I chose to work with javascript is to increase my skill level with this programming language as I don't have much experience with it.


#### My question now is which framework is the best for my project? 

#### The 3 most popular JavaScript frameworks are React, Vue and Angular. Let’s look at some pros and cons for each framework. 
### 1.	React: 
React is a popular choice for building dynamic and interactive web applications. Its virtual DOM feature enables fast rendering and updates, and its modular architecture makes it easy to build and maintain large-scale applications. React is also widely supported by a large community of developers, and there are many resources available for learning and troubleshooting. because react has such a large community it is easy to find tutorials about the topics you want to learn more about. For someone who has no experience with javascript this is a very important thing.
### 2.	Angular: 
Angular is a powerful framework that is ideal for building complex web applications. Its two-way data binding feature enables automatic updates to the user interface as data changes, and its dependency injection feature makes it easy to write reusable code. Angular is also well-suited for enterprise-level applications and has a large community and strong documentation. Because angular is great for large skill projects this makes it a bit overkill for such a small project as my own. Angular is also a framework that is a little bit more difficult to learn so because of this it won't be the right framework for my project since we have limited time.
### 3.	Vue: 
Vue is a lightweight and easy-to-learn framework that is well-suited for small to medium-sized applications. Its simple and intuitive syntax makes it easy for developers to learn and use. Vue doesn't have much documentation and tutorials making it harder to learn for someone without any experience with javascript.


# Conclusion:
after doing this research I am gonna choose to work with React. my reseasing for using react is mainly because it has the most documentation on the internet. React has a large cummintiy which makes it easier to learn for someone like me who has no exeperience with javascript. One more reason for me too choose React is because there are many tutorials with the Google Maps API (an API I'm planning to use) that use React. This will make it easier for me to follow. These two reasons are also why I'm not choosing for Vue since this framework doesn't have as much documentation. The reason I'm not choosing for Angalar is because of the fact that it's mostly used for large skill projects and my project is only a small one.
