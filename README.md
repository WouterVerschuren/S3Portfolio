## 1 Web application

You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications.

Clarification:

User friendly: You apply best practices when creating user interfaces and basic user experience testing and development techniques.

Full-stack: You design and build a full stack application using a commonly accepted front end Javascript framework and back end application implementing relevant communication protocols, persistence of data by usage of ORM and addressing asynchronous communication issues.


### how I plan to show this learning outcome in my project: 

To show I have enough knowledge of this learning outcome I made a frontend webapp using javascript. To know which javascript framework I am going to be using for my frontend I have made a [Research Paper](https://github.com/WouterVerschuren/S3Portfolio/blob/main/Documentation/Researches/Javascript%20Framework.md) on which javascript framework would be the best for me and my project. For my backend I made a WepAPI using asp.net C#. My database is being hosted on azure. 

I started of with some designs. with these designs I show that I have knowledge of the design part of this learning outcome.

I choice a very simple design with a minamalistic/clean look.

on the first page you'll see all the location's that have been added to the map. once you click on one of these location you'll see information about the location and a route on how to get there.
location's that haven't been checked by a moderator will show on the map but will be a red color indicating that they haven't been checked and also won't show a route on how to get there. I do this so that when places are illegal to go to won't be trespast.

on the third page you'll be able to see places you added yourself to the map. you will also be able to delete or edit locations here. 




## 2 Software quality

You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development.

Clarification:

Tooling and methodology: Carry out, monitor and report on unit integration, regression and system tests, with attention for security and performance aspects, as well as applying static code analysis and code reviews.

### how I plan to show this learning outcome in my project: 
to show that I have enough knowledge of this learning outcome I made a test plan of what I am going to test. 

## 3 Agile method

You choose and implement the most suitable agile software development method for your software project.

Clarification:

Choose: You are aware of the most popular agile methods and their underlying agile principles. Your choice of a method is motivated and based on well-defined selection criteria and context analyses.

### how I plan to show this learning outcome in my project: 

To show I have enough knowledge of this learning outcomes I made a [research paper](https://github.com/WouterVerschuren/S3Portfolio/blob/main/Documentation/Researches/AgileMethods.md) about what agile methods there are and which would work the best for me.

## group project:

### Scrum boards
#### [Frontend](https://github.com/orgs/Fontys-OAMK-Beter/projects/3/views/1) [backend](https://github.com/orgs/Fontys-OAMK-Beter/projects/2)

for a group project we choose to make use of the scrum agile method as this felt for us as the best method to use. As I worked with this group before in group projects, I knew that it was important for us to have a good planning and structure in the group. Scrum makes use of sprints that are about 3-4 weeks long and makes use of a scrum board where everyone can see what everyone is doing and see what is still left to do. this will give good structure to the group where needed. In the first few sprints we didn't fully implement the scrum processes, but we made continous improvements as well we gained more knowledge about how to use scrum so in later stages we began to make improvements. 

since scrum is designed for unpredicatbale projects with its adaptability, flexibility and continuous improvemnt. it's also great for a group project as we work together with people finland it can sometimes be a little bit harder to communicate between choices and options. hence it can be usefull to use scrum for when unexpected decisions weren't as intended and cause problems. in this the adaptability of scrum will make it easier to fix the problems you have.

## 4 CI/CD

You design and implement a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context.

Clarification:

Design and implement: You design a release process and implement a continuous integration and deployment solution (using e.g. Gitlab CI and Docker).

### how I plan to show this learning outcome in my project: 
To show I have enough knowledge of CI/CD I am hosting my frontend and back end in azure. 

## 5 Cultural differences and ethics

You recognize and take into account cultural differences between project stakeholders and ethical aspects in software development.

Clarifications:

Recognize: Recognition is based on theoretically substantiated awareness of cultural differences and ethical aspects in software engineering.

Take into account: Adapt your communication, working, and behavior styles to reflect project stakeholders from different cultures;

Address one of the standard Programming Ethical Guidelines (e.g., ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct) in your work.  

### how I plan to show this learning outcome in my project: 

## What is culture?
For me Culture is the beliefs, values and behvaiors someone has. people from the same culure usually connect on most of the same beliefs, values and behaviors as other people from the same culture. This gives culture the feeling of belonging. Cultures include traditions, languages, arts, sociol norms and knowledge. 

## what is my culture?
As a person who is dutch I tend to have a lot of trades from dutch culture. the most common of these trades is probably dutch directness. Dutch people usually tend to say what's on there mind and not think to much about what comes out of their mouth. This can both be a good thing and a bad thing, since it helps to show your opinion about something. but it can also be too direct sometimes and can be seen as offencif when you say something a bit too agressive. this is especially true when you're speaking with someone from a different culture where this is less common.


## What did you do to improve the group communications with respect to cultural differences?
For our group project we are currently working together with people from finland. Usually Finnish people tend to be a bit shy when you meet them for the first time and take a long time opening up. this sometimes made it diffecult to know if they were okay with certain decisions we made as they wouldn't be as harsh as we dutchies are used to. because of this we decided to make decisions we made them very clear so that they had enough time to give their honest opinion about them. We also made clear rules about everything so that everything was much easier to communicate between the group this helped everyone feel comfortable in both groups. As for myself I tried to be a lot calmer and softer with my replies as saying things to harsh could make the finnish people feel uncomfortable. We also had a group discord where we could discuss all our problems and ideas. This also helped us keep a good commmunication.

## 6 Requirements and Design

You analyze (non-functional) requirements, elaborate (architectural) designs and validate them using multiple types of test techniques.

Clarifications:

Multiple types of test techniques: You apply user acceptance testing and stakeholder feedback to validate the quality of the requirements. You evaluate the quality of the design (e.g., by testing or prototyping) taking into account the formulated quality properties like security and performance.

### how I plan to show this learning outcome in my project: 

to show I have enough knowledge of this learning outcome you've have previously seen [some designs](#1-Web-application) I made for my individual project. 
To test these user designs I created some simples user tests. 

To test my designs I got a few users to look at them and give me advise and/or feedback. I made sure to use different groups of people to make sure my designs where as good as can be.

## 7 Bussiness Process

You analyze and describe simple business processes that are related to your project.

Clarifications:

Simple: Involving stakeholders, predominantly sequential processes with one or two alternative paths.
Related: Business processes during which the software that you are developing will be used (business processes that the software must support by fully or partially automating them).
or
Business processes needed for the success of your software development project (e.g., product release, market release, financial assurance).

### how I plan to show this learning outcome in my project: 

## stakeholders analysis:

### what is a stake holder?
A stakeholder can be an person, group or organization that's impacted by the outcome of a project or business venture. The most important thing for a stakeholder is the succes of the project. The reason stakeholders are important in the project is that they can either have a positive or negative influence on the project with their decisions. Because of these influences that the stakeholders has it's important to choose someone who is fitted for the job to bo the stakeholder.

### Who are the stakeholders in my project and what are their goals and constraints? 
For our project We have three stakeholders: Frank, Samuil and Meija. their goal is to keep watch over the project and make sure everything goes as planned and the project ends in a succesfull way. to do this they look at the project together with engineers to make sure everything goes as planned and as was intended.

## Process analysis:

### What is a business process? 
A business process is an activity or multiple activities that accomplish a specific organized goal. The goal of a business process is to produce a consistent outcome and to be as specific as possible to do this. a bussiness project should have a purposeful goal.

### How does a business proces relate to software applications? 
BPM (Business Process management) relates with software in multiple ways:

- Automation and Efficiency: Software applications are often developed to automate and streamline business processes. by optimizing the technology organiztions can elimninate manual and time consuming tasks and this will make the efficiency higher.

- Workflow and Collaboration: software applications enforce the flow of the task and information within the business process. they provide a way to collaborate and communicate between employees, group members and stakeholders involved in the project. 

- Continuous Improvement: A business evolves and gets bigger over time. to support this contious growing and evolvement, software applicatoin can help by prividing flexibility, scalability and the ability to implement changes. When making use of feedback and iterative cycles software applications can be made to align witht the growing business requirements.

## Requirements analysis:

## Ethics analysis:

## 8 Professional

You act in a professional manner during software development and learning.

Clarification:

Professional manner: 

You develop software as a team effort according to a prescribed software methodology and following team agreements. You are able to track your work progress and communicate your progress with the team.

You actively ask and apply feedback from stakeholders and advise them on the most optimal technical and design (architectural) solutions.
You choose and substantiate solutions for a given problem.

### how I plan to show this learning outcome in my project: 

To show that I have enough knowledge of this learning outcome I made sure to ask feedback from my stakeholders and teachers. in the group project I did this in the form of showcases of our project where we got feedback from the stakeholders. once we got the feedback we made sure to discuse it in our group. for the individual project I made sure to ask for feedback from my teacher. I made sure to post this feedback in feedpulse so my teacher can clearly see what has been discussed and how I am planning to accomplish the things discused and explained. for our group project we also wrote peer reviews for eachother. this way everyone in our group could see where they could make improvements and see what they were doing good.
