## 1 Web application

You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications.

Clarification:

User friendly: You apply best practices when creating user interfaces and basic user experience testing and development techniques.

Full-stack: You design and build a full stack application using a commonly accepted front end Javascript framework and back end application implementing relevant communication protocols, persistence of data by usage of ORM and addressing asynchronous communication issues.


### how I plan to show this learning outcome in my project: 

To show I have enough knowledge of this learning outcome I made a frontend webapp using javascript. To know which javascript framework I am going to be using for my frontend I have made a [Research Paper](https://github.com/WouterVerschuren/S3Portfolio/blob/main/Documentation/Researches/Javascript%20Framework.md) on which javascript framework would be the best for me and my project. For my backend I made a WepAPI using asp.net C#. My database is being hosted on azure. 


## 2 Software quality

Address one of the standard Programming Ethical Guidelines (e.g., ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct) in your work.  

### how I plan to show this learning outcome in my project: 

## 6 Requirements and Design

You analyze (non-functional) requirements, elaborate (architectural) designs and validate them using multiple types of test techniques.

Clarifications:

Multiple types of test techniques: You apply user acceptance testing and stakeholder feedback to validate the quality of the requirements. You evaluate the quality of the design (e.g., by testing or prototyping) taking into account the formulated quality properties like security and performance.
