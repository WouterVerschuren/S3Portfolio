# Business process analysis:

### Introduction:
In this document I am going to look at the business process of my own webapp. In my project users will be able to share locations of cool buildings/places they found online. Users will be able to see all the information needed to find this location in real life. I am going to provide the reader with an overview of the existing business process, the analysis and improvements, the new process with data and role aspects, the roles involved, the steps supported/automated by the software, and a technical overview of the project. It concludes by highlighting the benefits and improvements that will be added with the creation of the Urban Explorer webapp. 

### The current business process:

Currently the process involves a user having to search for all the information themselves to search the locations they are looking for. This will take a lot of time and isn’t efficient for the users as this process relies on the user to look all around the internet to find these places. They can look at places like reddit or Facebook where people might share these places, but this isn’t one place where they all are. Also, it wouldn’t be very clear for users where these places are and the information about them.

### Existing business process:

As you can see in this diagram, you’ll see the business process visualized. In the Diagram all the activities are represented by a rectangle. The diamond will indicate the decision points and/or the alternative paths. The ovals will be represented by the roles that are involved in the process.

The process goes as follows:
1.	The user makes a request for urban explorer location online with an online search. 
2.	The user will then retrieve all the data he/she found. 
3.	Next the user will conclude whether this data is legit and safe. 
4.	If the data is not legit and/or save the user will start over with the process. 
5.	If the data is save, then the user will have the data.
Analysis and improvements:
When analyzing the existing process, I found that the process isn’t very reliable and safe. As data online may not be correct nor can it be trusted to be save information. this is the reason for the Urban explorer webapp as this can help to automate the process and make it reliable and safe to use without having to worry about ethical issues and correct information. as all the locations shown on the website will be checked by one of the administrators.
Updated process:
In the new and updated process, the user will be able to search and look for locations thru the Urban Explorer webapp this will help make it easier for them to find locations as they will all be displayed in one place, so they won’t have to deal with searching to whole internet. Not only will it be easier for the Users to find new locations it will also be much safer for them as with the use of the Urban Explorer all the locations that have been added will have been checked by an administrator.  

roles involved in the process:

the user is the main role in this process as the users does all the collecting of the data. With the help of the software the user won’t have to do the searching themselves as the software will display all the desired information this will reduce the time the user has to spent to find the data their looking for significantly. 


the new and updated process will look like this:

 

Steps:
1.	The user requests data from the Urban Explorer website
2.	The Urban Explorer website shows the available and requested data to the user.

Changes:
As you can see the diagram has been changed in a few ways since the existing process.

1.	The user doesn’t have to check if the data is correct or safe to use.
2.	The user won’t have to restart the search since the data is always safe since it has been checked by a moderator. 
3.	The process is much faster and more reliable. 
Conclusion:
The Urban Explorer website will help users achieve their end goal of finding the data they are looking for in a faster, safer and more user-friendly way. This is done by eliminating the searching process of the user by displaying all save and correct requested data in the same place. This will help reduce time and effort of the users search.
