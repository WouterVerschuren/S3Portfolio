# What are the ethical considerations and challenges associated with cross-cultural collaboration in a software development project between Finland and the Netherlands.

### Introducation:

When people from different cultures/countries work together on software development projects, there are ethical issues and challenges to consider before starting the project. In this research paper we will look at these issues and challenges, this includes topics like intellectual property, privacy, fairness, and cultural respect. the goal of this research paper is to find the best ways to work with challenges when creating a software project with different cultures.

### Objectives of this paper:

The objective of this paper is to find solutions to ethical issues between cross-cultural collaboration in a software development project between Finland and the Netherlands.
This information can help me create a better understanding of the differences between how Finnish people would work on a certain software problem and people from the Netherlands. This in turn could help future collaboration between the two countries.

### What are the differences in ethics in software in the Netherlands and Finland?

##### Software ethics can vary between countries based on cultural, legal, and social factors. Here are some differences we can find between the Netherlands and Finland:

### Data Privacy: 
Both Finland and the Netherlands have strong data protection laws in place. Finland is known for its strict privacy regulations. This includes the Personal Data Act (PDA) and the EU's General Data Protection Regulation [(GDPR)](https://www.smartglobalgovernance.com/en/finland-privacy/#:~:text=The%20Data%20Protection%20Act%20protects,it%20is%20of%20fundamental%20value.). The Netherlands also upholds GDPR and has additional legislation, such as the Dutch Data Protection Act [(Wbp)](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_bescherming_persoonsgegevens_(Nederland)). However, Finland generally places a strong emphasis on privacy rights, and this may influence software ethics in terms of data handling and user consent.

### Openness and Transparency: 
Finland has a tradition of openness and transparency, which can extend to software development and ethical practices. The concept of "Open Finland" promotes the transparency of government data and public services. The Netherlands also values openness, particularly in governance, and emphasizes transparency in public administration. You'll see this transparency in software ethics reflect in both countries.

### Social Responsibility: 
Finnish society often emphasizes social responsibility, including in software development. Ethical considerations regarding fairness, equality, and the well-being of individuals and communities are important. Finland has a strong welfare state and values equal access to technology. Finland is consired one of the best countries to live in dew to the well formed laws and stable living situations. this reflects in there software regulations aswell. The Netherlands also values social responsibility, with a focus on sustainable development, diversity, and inclusion. These values may influence software ethics by promoting equitable software access and development practices.

### problems and challenges:

when working together with people from multiple different countries there can arise a few problems and challenges. one of these challenges is the difference in native language. since both finland and the netherlands speak different languages it's impossible to talk with our native tongue. Another problem that may acure is the difference in cultural in social differences. this can be a challenge for example since Dutch people are usually direct and say what comes to their mind, while finnish people are more kept to them themselves and usually a bit more afraid to say what they think. another thing to take into consideration when working together with people from finland is that there is a 1 hour time difference. This will also makes the challenge into planning things or meetings. communication can also be a big problem as you are so far apart.


### how to overcome these problems and challenges:

one of the challenges is the language difference but thankfully nowadays if there is any confusion you can use translate software to translate things you don't understand. and since most of Finland and the netherlands [speak english](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/11/countries-that-speak-english-as-a-second-language/), there isn't that much of a language barrier. when it comes to cultural difference you can make sure to look into some of the ethical differences between and the netherlands and you can look at the culture of the other country to make sure you understand their ways of living. when it comes to social differnces it's important to make sure you understand the way the other person does certain things and know the way they speak. in the example of dutch people being direct and finnish people being more to themselves, as a dutch person you could make sure that the finnish person is comfortable and you don't say things to blunt or harsh. for the finnish people it could be the oppisite as they could say things a bit more direct. to work around the the time difference it's important to keep a good planning where you both show the dutch time and the finnish time. so that everyone knows the right time of meetings and presenatations. to make sure you everyone is kept up to date, you can create a discord server where you can communicate and discuss all problems and other things.
