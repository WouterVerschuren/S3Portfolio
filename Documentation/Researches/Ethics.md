For this research I am going to be using Library study (library) and observation (field) methods from the DOT-framework. this means that I will be searching for information and data about the topic and I will also use the information I got from working together with the Finnish people.

### Introducation:

When people from different cultures/countries work together on software development projects, there are ethical issues and challenges to consider before starting the project. In this research paper we will look at these issues and challenges, this includes topics like intellectual property, privacy, fairness, and cultural respect. the goal of this research paper is to find the best ways to work with challenges when creating a software project with different cultures.

### Objectives of this paper:

The objective of this paper is to find solutions to ethical issues between cross-cultural collaboration in a software development project between Finland and the Netherlands.
This information can help me create a better understanding of the differences between how Finnish people would work on a certain software problem and people from the Netherlands. This in turn could help future collaboration between the two countries.

### What are the differences in ethics in software in the Netherlands and Finland?

##### Software ethics can vary between countries based on cultural, legal, and social factors. Here are some differences we can find between the Netherlands and Finland:

### Data Privacy: 
Both Finland and the Netherlands have strong data protection laws in place. Finland is known for its strict privacy regulations. This includes the Personal Data Act (PDA) and the EU's General Data Protection Regulation [(GDPR)](https://www.smartglobalgovernance.com/en/finland-privacy/#:~:text=The%20Data%20Protection%20Act%20protects,it%20is%20of%20fundamental%20value.). The Netherlands also upholds GDPR and has additional legislation, such as the Dutch Data Protection Act [(Wbp)](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_bescherming_persoonsgegevens_(Nederland)). However, Finland generally places a strong emphasis on privacy rights, and this may influence software ethics in terms of data handling and user consent.

### Openness and Transparency: 
Finland has a tradition of openness and transparency, which can extend to software development and ethical practices. The concept of "Open Finland" promotes the transparency of government data and public services. The Netherlands also values openness, particularly in governance, and emphasizes transparency in public administration. You'll see this transparency in software ethics reflect in both countries.

### Social Responsibility: 
Finnish society often emphasizes social responsibility, including in software development. Ethical considerations regarding fairness, equality, and the well-being of individuals and communities are important. Finland has a strong welfare state and values equal access to technology. Finland is consired one of the best countries to live in dew to the well formed laws and stable living situations. this reflects in there software regulations aswell. The Netherlands also values social responsibility, with a focus on sustainable development, diversity, and inclusion. These values may influence software ethics by promoting equitable software access and development practices.

#### 1. power Distance:
When it comes to Power Distance Finland and the Netherlands both score pretty low this means that both countries are keen on equal rights. This means that attitude towards higher ups are informal and usually on a first name basis. This also means that power is decentralized and managers count on the experience of their team members.

#### 2. individualism:
When it comes to individualism the netherlands scores a lot higher then finland. This means that in the netherlands people are expected to take care of themselves and family individually while in Finland it's more common to help other people. 

#### 3. masculinity:
When it comes to masculinity Finland scores a little higher then the Netherlands. This means that Finland is a country that is more driven by competition. achievement and succes while the Netherlands is a more feminine country. This means that in the Netherlands it's more important that all are included. descision making is done by involvement. equality is the biggest facture in this decision making.

#### 4. uncertainty avoidance:
When it comes to uncertainty avoicedance Finland and the Netherlands both score fairly similar. This means that for both countries it's really imporant that there are good rules even if they don't seem to work. Both countries need to be sure there goood rigid codes of believe to make sure everything goes by rules. This will help against confusion and time waste. 


#### 5. long term orientation:
When it comes to long term orientation the Netherlands score much higher then Finland. This means that for Finland it's important to establish a absolute truth, meaning they have a normative way of thinking. the tend to respect traditions and have relatively small propensity to save for the future. This is why they like quick results more then better long term results. In the Netherlands its different. In the Netherlands we think more in a long term way. we show that we easily adopt traditions to changed conditions. we have a big prospority to save and invest in the future. 

#### 6. indulgence:
When it comes to indulgence the Netherlands scores a little higher then Finland. This means that both countries tend to be more to the optemistic side and both value their free time as a big importance. they also act as they please and like to spend their money the way the want. Since the Netherlands scores a little higher this all goes for the Netherlands a little more.

### Examples & Own Experiences:
In our group project I noticed that the Dutch people worked much more long term oriented while the Finnish people worked more in a short term perspective. you could notice that when looking at the planning. The planning that the Dutch people made already had user stories of things that where expected to be build in later stages of the project. We also looked more at future challenges and  made sure the project as a whole went fluently. In the Finnish group you could notice that this wasn't the case as they worked more in a short term ortiented way. The tried to finnish a user story as fast as possible without looking at the long term project. When it comes to individualism I also noticed some differences. As for the Dutch people we worked a lot for ourselves and only discused things as a group while on the other hand the Finnish people did most of the things together and worked on the same things at the same time. I also noticed that in our group we were expected to finnish our own work and we believed in our own capabilities. When it comes to indulgence I also noticed a little difference between both countries. as the dutch group definnitly was more optimistic about finishing the project while the Finnish people were more stressed about it. and you noticed that finnish people were a little more to themselves while the Dutch people where very open and weren't afraid to be themselves.

### problems and challenges:

When working together with people from multiple different countries there can arise a few problems and challenges. One of these challenges is the difference in native language. Since both finland and the netherlands speak different languages it's impossible to talk with our native tongue. Another problem that may acure is the difference in cultural in social differences. this can be a challenge for example since Dutch people are usually direct and say what comes to their mind, while finnish people are more kept to them themselves and usually a bit more afraid to say what they think. Another thing to take into consideration when working together with people from finland is that there is a 1 hour time difference. This will also makes the challenge into planning things or meetings. Communication can also be a big problem as you are so far apart.


### how to overcome these problems and challenges:

One of the challenges is the language difference but thankfully nowadays if there is any confusion you can use translate software to translate things you don't understand. and since most of Finland and the netherlands [speak english](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/11/countries-that-speak-english-as-a-second-language/), there isn't that much of a language barrier. when it comes to cultural difference you can make sure to look into some of the ethical differences between and the netherlands and you can look at the culture of the other country to make sure you understand their ways of living. when it comes to social differnces it's important to make sure you understand the way the other person does certain things and know the way they speak. in the example of dutch people being direct and finnish people being more to themselves, as a dutch person you could make sure that the finnish person is comfortable and you don't say things to blunt or harsh. for the finnish people it could be the oppisite as they could say things a bit more direct. to work around the the time difference it's important to keep a good planning where you both show the dutch time and the finnish time. so that everyone knows the right time of meetings and presenatations. to make sure you everyone is kept up to date, you can create a discord server where you can communicate and discuss all problems and other things.
