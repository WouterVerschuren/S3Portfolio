# What is the most effective agile method and practice for optimizing software development?


## What is Agile?
Agile is a set of frameworks and practices that aim to improve software development. agile is used within a group to make sure that the group finish the project in phases and it helps with continuos collaboration and improvemnt.

## the 12 principles of agile:

1. The highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.

8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

10. Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.

11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

there are many agile methods you can use but the 4 most used ones are:
- scrum
- kanban
- extreme programming
- lean development

### since scrum and kanban are the most used agile methods I am goin in more depth with them.

## Scrum:
3. Scrum
Scrum is a popular Agile method and the one that I personally have the most experience with, as it is the recommended method within our study. since it is the most popular agile method to use. for our group project we choose to use scrum aswell.

3.1. Scrum process
the scrum process starts with the creating of user stories. Once you have created the user stories they will be put on a scrum board. Every user story on the scrum board will be asigned a number. This will number (story point) will represent the expected amount of effert that is required to complete this user story. this way you can easily see how much time you are currently having to spend to finish the project. in the beginning of the project you'll make a planning using these user stories. when creating th planning you can look at the number you've given a certain user story and this will tell you how much time it is expected to cost. these user stories will then be placed in the backlog. Every morning you work on the project there will be a stand-up, this will be at a set location and time. in this stand-up session 

A Scrum project starts with formulating user stories. Once these have been formulated they are put in a product backlog and are assigned a number of story points—these represent the expected amount of effort required to complete the user story. At the start of a sprint a sprint planning is performed. During this session a number of user stories are selected to be worked on during the sprint and these user stories are then placed in the sprint backlog. During the sprint a daily scrum (sometimes referred to as a stand-up) is held each day at a set time and location. This is a time-boxed session (approximately 15 minutes), facilitated by an appointed Scrum master/leader, where team members report on their progress, any problems or issues encountered, and the task(s) they intend to work on during the course of the day. During the course of the sprint work is put into one or more increments. These are concrete steps towards the end goal of the project and must be usable, tested and work well together. At the end of a sprint a sprint review is held where the completed work gets presented to the stakeholders. This provides an opportunity for the development team to receive feedback, discuss impact of incomplete work and to receive suggestions for upcoming work from the stakeholders. This can also be a good moment to review the user stories in the product backlog and amend, update or re-order them if needed. The last part of a sprint is the sprint retrospective. During this session the team reflects on the past sprint(s): what went well and what could be improved in the next sprint. If a large number of points for improvement are found, a selection should be made based on what the team determines are the points with the highest priority. After this step the project is either finished or enters the cycle anew and starts with a new sprint.

3.2. Extensions to Scrum
There are also several additional techniques that can be used to augment the Scrum process:

Burndown chart: a chart showing the remaining work in a sprint (usually in the form of total story points) against the time available in a sprint. It includes an ideal progress line sloping down from the start of the sprint to the end and the team can use this to help them remain on schedule by updating it each day and comparing actual and predicted progress.
Definition of done: Clear definition for when a user story can be considered finished. May include rules relating to unit/integration/regression testing, security requirements/checks, and requirements for proper documentation and code review.
Spike: a time-boxed period used to research a new concept/technology, create a proof of concept, or a prototype. A spike may or may not produce a tangible outcome. It ends when the time has expired, not necessarily when the objective has been achieved.
3.3. Scrum values
Also part of the Scrum method are a set of five core values: courage, focus, commitment, respect and openness. Commitment to these values by each member of the team is considered important for the successful use of Scrum. Together they help building trust and support the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

## Kanban:
Kanban 
With Kanban you make use of a kanban board. A kanban board is an agile project management tool desgined to help visualize your work. it also helps visualize your limit work-in-progress and it maximizes your efficiency. 


A kanban board consist of cards and columns. Since the kanban board makes use of cards, where team members write all of there work items on, the kanban board is a very easy to read. You can easily see what is still left to do and what is done already. A card is usually a user story. Another thing that the kanban board has are columns. Each column you see on the kanban board represents a specific workflow. the cards flow thru this workflow until they are completed. a workflow can be something simple like "to do", "in progress", "complete" but they can also get more complicated. 

another thing that the kanban board makes use of is work in progress limits (WIP limits). These limits are there to show the maximum number of cards in a column at any given time. so when a column has a WIP limit of 5. the column can only have 5 cards. when a column is full a team can focus on this column so that it they can add new cards to that flow. This will help the team members to find bottlenecks in there projects since you can see when you have to much work at once in the kanban board.

kanban boards also consists of a commitment and delivery point. a commitment point is the  moments when a teams picks up one of the ideas from the backlog that's been added there by the team. The delivery moment is when the product is in the hand of the customer so basically when the product is done. A teams goal is to move cards from the commitment point to the delivery point as fast as possible. 


## Extreme Programming (XP):
Extreme Programming is an agile method that use a lot of frequent communication and collaboration. extreme programming also puts customer satisfaction and focusing on delivering high-quality software through practices like pair programming and test-driven development first. however it requires a significant shift in team culture and this may cause it to be challenging to use in large projects or teams.

## Lean Development:
lean development is an agile method that focuses on delivering good products and promoting contiuouns improvement and effiency. however lean development also requires a thorough understanding of the lean principles and a lot of upfront planning. this causes it to be challenging to implement.

## Our project:
For our group project we choose to use scrum as we think this agile method would give us the most structure in our group. Structure is very important to us. Since I have worked with this group before I know that we really need a structured and good planning and a good knowledge of our other team mates to be able to finish our project I think that scrum will be the best option. The Scrum board will give a clear indecation of what everyone is doing at the moment. This will help us as we have experienced before that if we don't know whate everyone is doing in our group we get less done and make a lot more mistakes.
